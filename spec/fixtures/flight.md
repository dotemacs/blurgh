date: 20110325

Restrictions on flights to and from the UK have been extended until
0700 BST on Sunday, as the danger to planes from volcanic ash from
Iceland continues.  A few domestic flights may be able to take off
from Scotland and Northern Ireland before 1900 BST on Saturday, but
most planes will remain grounded.
